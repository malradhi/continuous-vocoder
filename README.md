# Continuous Vocoder
It is a software for speech analysis and synthesis. It can estimate continuous parameters: Fundamental frequency (F0), maximum voiced frequency (MVF) and spectral envelope (MGC). It also generate the speech like input speech using only 3 estimated continuous parameters with lower dimensions.

Continuous vocoder can be used for Statistical Parametric Speech Synthesis (SPSS), Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Voice Conversion (VC).
